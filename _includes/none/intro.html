The Computational Research Facilitation team at the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine together aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research and pipeline development and high performance computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts of nextflow programming and bioinformatics pipeline development. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
